Device agents scripts for provisioning and running tests on Snappy
devices

Only BeagleBone Black is supported for the moment, and for provisioning
to work properly, things have to be set up in a very specific way.  Once
we have devices in the lab, this will be made a little more generic, but
will probably always require specialized hardware to be fully automated.
