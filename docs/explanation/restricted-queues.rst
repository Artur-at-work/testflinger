Restricted Queues
=================

Restricted queues are queues that are access controlled. These queues only let
clients with the correct authorisation push jobs to them. This requires
:doc:`authenticating <./authentication>` with Testflinger server and obtaining
a token.

Contact an administrator if you would like access to a restricted queue or if you would like to create your own restricted queue.
